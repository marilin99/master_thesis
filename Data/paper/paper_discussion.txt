FiBar meeting notes (30.06)

* tool paper 
* template options - journals 
* examples: gprofiler, pawer and others. 
* start with high-lvl journals (nature comm-s, nar, bmc, oxford)
* expectations - dima will just be reading
* both pipelines should be described - fiber and bacteria analysis 
* biomaterial angle 
* installer vs web tools
* MIT licence q - conditions, purposes - cite, permissible 
* libraries' citations
* pre-print: not important 
* deadline: end of august 
* holidays: karin end of 14.08, dima: 02.-22.07, marta: 3 weeks 


### possible improvements ###

* git improvements: commit recent work 
* ocr improvement: consider floodfill instead - comparing to the known values
* find a better way to automatize the system - email based for now - maybe consider a button or sth that would trigger it in the pc?
* check 
* crossing check?
* perpendicularity check compared to the starting point 
* bacteria pipeline adaptivity
* installer creation

I think that this could be a tool paper, rather than analysis paper, hence no need for a very thorough analysis of some specific data, just sufficient to show that your tool works

I agree that this is a tool paper, and I actually would like that both analyses methods (SEM+ bacteria) would be included....but again we can discuss this. 

Journal verdict 

1) it seemed that Nature Methods might not be a good venue for us, because they are normally looking for wide-ranging applications in biology, I am not sure if the domain the tool Marilin has developed covers wide enough ground there. Instead, we might want to try Nature Biotechnology, which has a bit narrower scope. Here is a tool paper published in this journal: https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3122#Sec2. There are also Nature Communications and Nature Scientific Reports (in this order) that publish different things.

2) Also, NAR may only be good if we go for a web-tool option, which does not seem to be the case at this point.

3) Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics, and PLOS ONE all seem to be relevant and good.


She proposed collaborating on this tool, getting help from our developers to make a web tool, submitting it to Nature Biotechnology, and also getting the tool listed on their Elixir website https://elixir.ut.ee/services. This would also ensure the tool is supported even after Marilin moves on to something else.

If we really want to start with Nature group journals then it might fit better to Nature Materials (compared to Nature Biotechnology): 

--> Nature Materials then? 

###

hedi - karin - marta - marilin - dima sit-down 

principle things: is everyone fairly treated? 
potential users - what is the approx. amount? 
expectations: maintaining the tool and development funding from karin's side? 

august-sept on-site 

if we wish to take the elixir path: sw evaluation, professionalism, completely different writing;
if someone wants to cite the tool: thesis for now;

pre-print option? paper format?
